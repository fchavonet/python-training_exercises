# Training Exercices

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created as part of my training and experimentation with the language. Each script represents a practical exercise aimed at improving my programming skills, testing concepts, or exploring the functionality of specific libraries. It serves as a hands-on approach to learning, providing a space to apply theoretical knowledge and develop real-world solutions.

## Objectives

- Document my learning journey with Python.
- Practice writing clean, functional, and maintainable code.
- Explore and experiment with various Python libraries and features.
- Apply theoretical knowledge through hands-on exercises.
- Build a solid foundation for tackling more advanced projects in the future.

```

For the `brickset_finder.py` script, you need to create a `config.json` file at the root of the project directory with the following content:

```
{
    "api_key": "<api key number>"
}
```

You can request an API key from this page: [Brickset API key request](https://brickset.com/tools/webservices/requestkey).
