## 📝 <span id="description">Description</span>

This repository contains a collection of Python scripts created as part of my training and experimentation with the language. Each script represents a practical exercise aimed at improving my programming skills, testing concepts, or exploring the functionality of specific libraries. It serves as a hands-on approach to learning, providing a space to apply theoretical knowledge and develop real-world solutions.

## 🎓 <span id="objectives">Objectives</span>

The main objective of this repository is to document my journey in mastering Python programming. Whether it’s writing simple scripts, learning a new library, or testing small projects, I strive to create clean and functional code. These exercises allow me to deepen my understanding of the language while building a strong foundation for tackling more advanced challenges in the future.

## 💻 <span id="installation_and_how_to_use">Installation and how to use</span>

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository:
    - Open your preferred Terminal.
    - Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
    - Run the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fchavonet/web-simple_reminder.git
```

2. Open the repository you've just cloned.

3. Ensure Python is installed.

4. Create a virtual environment:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

5. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Linux/macOS:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

- On Windows:

```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

6. Install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

7. To test a program, run one of these commands:

```
./brickset_finder.py
```

For the `brickset_finder.py` script, you need to create a `config.json` file at the root of the project directory with the following content:

```
{
    "api_key": "<api key number>"
}
```

You can request an API key from this page: [Brickset API key request](https://brickset.com/tools/webservices/requestkey).

```
./connect_four.py
```

---

```
./currency_converter.py
```

---

```
./egg_cooking_timer.py
```

---

```
./mental_arithmetic.py
```

---

```
./mystery_number.py
```

---

```
./password_generator.py
```

---

```
./simon.py
```

---

```
./youtube_video_downloader.py
```

This script is obsolete due to recent changes in YouTube's platform and the lack of updates to the library it relies on, rendering it unable to function properly.
